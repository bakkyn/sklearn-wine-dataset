# Classifying with Sklearn Wine Dataset

This is a data exploring study. It can be regarded as a work performed for data mining. You can see the descriptions along with the codes to be helpful in this regard. The data set used is taken from Sklearn library.

The <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_wine.html">wine dateset </a>is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset.

Classes  3 <br>
Samples per class [59,71,48] <br>
Samples total 178 <br>
Dimensionality 13 <br>
Features real, positive <br>

This assignment is suggested to complete on Google colab to benefit from its GPU support. <br>
Linear SVM, NonLinear SVM, MLP classifiers have been applied in general, and some results are as follows; the detailed form is in the outputs in the code.<br>

Comparing of prediction results of each classifier based on accuracy
SVC with linear : 0.5925925925925926<br>
SVC with RBF : 0.7407407407407407<br>
SVC with polynomial : 0.7407407407407407 <br>
SVC with Sigmoid : 0.35185185185185186<br>
